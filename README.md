This program is a simple Rust implementation of a TCP server that listens on a specific port 6379 and responds to any incoming message from clients.

The program uses the Tokio asynchronous runtime, which allows for efficient handling of many connections concurrently. When a new client connects, a new task is spawned to handle the connection, and the main loop continues to listen for incoming connections.

To run the program, simply execute the command "cargo run" in the directory containing the source code. The program will then listen on port 6379 for incoming connections.

Note: This program is a basic implementation and is not intended for production use. Security considerations and error handling have not been addressed.
